A junior colleague went on vacation and handed over a half-done application for you to finish.

He is a very keen learner and benefits a lot from good feedback. Please finish the application and <b>provide a thorough review</b>, touching on all of the issues with the code, explaining the what and the why. Feel free to refactor anything you deem appropriate.

This is a basic TODO list application. Requirements are as such:

- Should keep a list of tasks which can be "active" and "completed".
- New task is added as "active".
- Clicking on "active" task marks it as "completed" by crossing it out.
- Should show a total count of all tasks in the list.
- Name for a new task is specified by typing in an input field.

On top of initial requirements our analytics team has recently discovered two things:

- Some of our future users prefer dark mode.
- Some of our future users might have disabilities such as visual or mobility impairments.

Please adjust the app to accommodate their needs.

If there is anything unclear about the exact requirements, use your best judgement. There is no one right solution so you are welcome to add a small report with your reasoning of implementation choices.

Styling of the application is not important, the screenshot below added just for your own inspiration.
